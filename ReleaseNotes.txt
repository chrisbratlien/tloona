ApplicationName : Tloona
==

Description :
    Tloona is an IDE for Tcl/Tk. Its main features are a syntax highlighted editor,
    a code browser and a command "REPL". Projects are directories with the ending 
    .vfs, which can later be deployed via Tclkits (nevertheless all directories can
    be opened as projects). Procedures, classes etc. can be send to the integrated 
    REPL or to another interpreter via the comm Package. Both of these features are
    very useful for dynamic development and testing.
    The project was inspired by Eclipse and Lisp/SLIME, so the graphical environment
    is a mixture of parts of an Eclipse IDE and the SLIME environment for Emacs. 
    This makes it a very good fit for the development of small to large Tcl/Tk 
    applications, desktop and web. Nevertheless it is also useful for tiny 
    administration scripts.
    
    Tloona runs with ActiveTcl 8.4 or 8.5 (http://www.activestate.com/activetcl). 
    The dependencies can be installed via teacup, which can be done with the script
    "install_dependencies.tcl" in the main directory of Tloona. Then click on 
    "main.tcl" to run the program.
